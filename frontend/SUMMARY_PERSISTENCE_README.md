# Summary Generation Persistence Solution

## Problem Solved

Previously, when users minimized the summary dialog and then reopened it, the summary generation would restart from the beginning, causing:
1. **Unnecessary API calls** - The same summary would be generated multiple times
2. **Poor user experience** - Users would lose progress and have to wait again
3. **Resource waste** - Backend processing time and computational resources were wasted

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global State Management
- **SummaryContext**: A React Context that manages summary state globally across the application
- **Persistent State**: Summary data persists even when components unmount/remount
- **Request Tracking**: Active summary generation requests are tracked to prevent duplicates

### 2. Key Components

#### `SummaryContext.tsx`
- Manages global summary state using React useReducer
- Tracks active requests with AbortController
- Provides actions for starting, completing, and failing summaries
- Handles cleanup of completed requests

#### `useSummaryGeneration.ts`
- Custom hook that handles summary generation logic
- Prevents duplicate requests for the same document
- Manages AbortController for request cancellation
- Provides cleanup on component unmount

#### `SummaryDialog.tsx`
- Persistent dialog component that doesn't unmount when minimized
- Uses global state to display summary data
- Shows loading states and error handling
- Provides minimize/maximize functionality

### 3. Features

#### Request Deduplication
```typescript
// Check if there's already an active request for this document
if (hasActiveRequest(docId)) {
  console.log(`Summary generation already in progress for document ${docId}`);
  return null;
}
```

#### Persistent State
```typescript
// Check if we already have a summary for this document
const existingSummary = getSummary(docId);
if (existingSummary?.content) {
  return existingSummary.content;
}
```

#### Proper Cleanup
```typescript
// Cleanup effect to abort active requests when component unmounts
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    Object.values(state.activeRequests).forEach(controller => {
      if (controller) {
        controller.abort();
      }
    });
  };
}, [state.activeRequests]);
```

### 4. User Experience Improvements

1. **No More Restarts**: Summary generation continues in the background even when dialog is minimized
2. **Instant Display**: Previously generated summaries appear immediately when dialog is reopened
3. **Progress Preservation**: Loading states are maintained across dialog minimize/maximize
4. **Smart Notifications**: Users are notified when summaries are ready while minimized

### 5. Technical Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: No duplicate requests for the same document
2. **Better Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of aborted requests
3. **Improved Performance**: Cached summaries load instantly
4. **Error Handling**: Better error states and retry functionality

## Usage

The solution is automatically integrated into the existing DocumentsPage. Users can:

1. Click "View Summary" on any document
2. Minimize the dialog while summary is generating
3. Switch to other documents or tabs
4. Return to the summary dialog - it will show the completed summary or continue loading

## Backend Integration

The solution works with the existing backend API:
- `POST /documents/summary/{doc_id}` - Generates summary for a document
- No backend changes required
- Leverages the improved summary generation from the enhanced models

## Future Enhancements

1. **Summary Caching**: Store summaries in localStorage for offline access
2. **Batch Processing**: Allow multiple summaries to be generated simultaneously
3. **Progress Indicators**: Show detailed progress for long-running summaries
4. **Background Processing**: Generate summaries automatically after document upload
